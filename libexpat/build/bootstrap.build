# The Expat version has the <major>.<minor>.<micro> form and follows the
# semver semantics, according to the documentation in expat/lib/expat.h
# present in the latest library version (2.2.9 at the time of this writing).
#
# The ABI version doesn't correlate with the release version and is assigned
# via the libtool's -version-info <current>:<revision>:<age> option
# (LIBCURRENT, LIBREVISION, and LIBAGE in expat/configure.in). As it follows
# from the comment in expat/configure.in, the major version (current - age) is
# incremented for backwards-incompatible ABI changes.
