Expat is a stream-oriented XML parsing C library. This means that you register
handlers with the parser before starting the parse. These handlers are called
when the parser discovers the associated structures (start tag, etc) in the
document being parsed. For more information see:

https://libexpat.github.io/

This package contains the original libexpat library source code overlaid with
the build2-based build system and packaged for the build2 package manager
(bpkg).

See the INSTALL file for the prerequisites and installation instructions.

Post questions, bug reports, or any other feedback about the library itself at
https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/issues. Send build system and
packaging-related feedback to the packaging@build2.org mailing list (see
https://lists.build2.org for posting guidelines, etc).

The packaging of Expat for build2 is tracked in a Git repository at:

https://git.build2.org/cgit/packaging/expat/
