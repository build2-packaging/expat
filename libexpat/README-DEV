This document describes how libexpat was packaged for build2. In particular,
this understanding will be useful when upgrading to a new upstream version.
See ../README-DEV for general notes on Expat packaging.

Symlink the required upstream files:

$ ln -s ../COPYING
$ pushd libexpat
$ ln -s ../../upstream/expat/lib/{*.{c,h},libexpat.def.cmake} ./
$ ln -s ../../upstream/expat/expat_config.h.cmake expat_config.h.cmake.orig
$ popd

@@ TMP Note that the in module can't be used directly for libexpat.def.cmake
       since the substitution variables we need to use start with the
       underscore character, which ends up with the following error:

       buildfile:28:3: error: variable name '_EXPAT_COMMENT_ATTR_INFO' is reserved
         info: variable name starts with underscore

       This can be fixed when the build2 version 0.16.0 is released, which
       introduces the in.substitutions variable, which can be set to the list
       of substitutions (key-value pairs).

       For now we just copy libexpat.def.cmake to libexpat.def.in and patch it
       manually, removing the leading underscores.

Use some of the upstream's tests for testing:

$ pushd unit-tests/regression/
$ ln -s ../../../upstream/expat/tests/*.{c,h} ./
$ popd

Create libexpat/expat_config.h using as a base the upstream's auto-generated
header, winconfig.h, and/or configure.ac.

Re-creating libexpat/expat_config.h from scratch every time we upgrade to a
new upstream version would be a pain. Instead we can only (un)define the newly
introduced macros, comparing the already defined and currently used macro
sets. Note that we can use this approach to also deduce the initial set of
macros running the above commands for the upstream's auto-generated
expat_config.h:

$ ln -s ../../upstream/expat/expat_config.h.cmake libexpat/expat_config.h.cmake.orig

$ for m in `cat libexpat/expat_config.h.cmake.orig libexpat/winconfig.h | \
            sed -n 's/.*#\s*\(define\|cmakedefine\)\s\{1,\}\([_a-zA-Z0-9]\{1,\}\)\(\s.*\)\{0,1\}$/\2/p' | sort -u`; do
    if grep -q -e "\b$m\b" `find -L . -type f -not -path "./tests/*" -a \( -name '*.h' -a ! -name expat_config.h -o -name '*.c' \)`; then
      echo "$m"
    fi
  done >used-macros

$ cat libexpat/expat_config.h | \
  sed -n 's/^#\s*\(define\|undef\)\s\{1,\}\([_a-z_A-Z0-9]\{1,\}\)\(\s.*\)\{0,1\}$/\2/p' | \
  sort -u >defined-macros

$ diff defined-macros used-macros | grep '<' >remove-macros
$ diff defined-macros used-macros | grep '>' >add-macros
