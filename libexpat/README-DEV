This document describes how libexpat was packaged for build2. In particular,
this understanding will be useful when upgrading to a new upstream version.
See ../README-DEV for general notes on Expat packaging.

Symlink the required upstream files:

$ ln -s ../COPYING
$ pushd libexpat
$ ln -s ../../upstream/expat/lib/*.{c,h} ./
$ rm watcomconfig.h winconfig.h
$ ln -s ../../upstream/expat/lib/libexpat.def libexpat.def.orig
$ popd

Use some of the upstream's tests for testing:

$ pushd tests/regression/
$ ln -s ../../../upstream/expat/tests/*.{c,h} ./
$ popd
